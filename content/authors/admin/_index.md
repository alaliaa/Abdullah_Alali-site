I am a **Ph.D. Data Scientist** skilled in developing cutting-edge **machine learning models** to solve technical challenges. Currently, I work at **CNTXT** as a Data Scientist, where I lead the development of AI capabilities with a focus on **Generative AI** for the InSafe product. My responsibilities include architecting advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems and developing **AI agents** using frameworks such as Langchain, Llamaindex, and CrewAI.

I received my Ph.D. in Earth Science and Engineering (Machine Learning Track) from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2023, where my dissertation focused on "Advances of deep learning in geophysical challenges: 4D seismic processing and salt inversion" under the supervision of Tariq Alkhalifah. I have experience applying complex AI/ML models, including CNNs and temporal networks, to challenging data analysis problems, particularly in subsurface imaging and monitoring. 

My professional experience includes roles at SLB as a Research Engineer and at Saudi Aramco as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I developed ML models for geophysical applications. I have also served as a Teaching Assistant at KAUST, enhancing student understanding of complex graduate-level geophysics concepts.

I am passionate about leveraging deep learning expertise in data science, with a particular interest in Generative AI applications and AI agent development for industrial applications.
